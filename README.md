This is a basic Node.js backend structure for an e-commerce application.

## Project Structure

- `routes/` — API route definitions
- `models/` — Database connection and models
- `utils/` — Utility functions (e.g., email service)
- `.env` — Environment variables
- `server.js` — Entry point

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:

   npm start
   ```
